                        <h2>Tabitual - Final Project for Electronic Rituals</h2>
                    <p><b>Ritual</b>- “the performance of more or less invariant sequences of 
                        formal acts and utterances not entirely encoded by the performers” 
                        (Rappaport p. 24)
                    </p>
                    <p>We perform rituals on a daily basis, whether we realize it or not. 
                        Some are meticulously thought out and planned events such as weddings, 
                        Christmas, court procedures, prayers, etc., while others are performed 
                        on a rather subconscious level. Actions as mundane as waving to 
                         a friend or sipping coffee while checking your emails every morning 
                         can be considered ritualistic activities even though they lack the 
                         formality of what is commonly considered to be a ‘ritual’.</p>
                         <p>This project aims to explore one of the more subconscious rituals 
                            but adds an element of intentionality to see how it would affect 
                            one’s day in terms of their mindset, emotions, and actions.</p>
                    <p>The ritual activity I chose to focus on is the action of 
                        <b>opening up a new tab in the Chrome Browser</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>Opening up a new browser tab is usually the first step we take to get 
                        anywhere/do anything on the internet. Because of this, people have 
                        purposely made available the option to customize one’s new tab, 
                        aesthetics-wise and functionality-wise. Personally, I greatly value 
                        this feature of Chrome, always looking for new Chrome extensions that 
                        can improve my digital experience and changing my Chrome theme every few months.</p>
                    <p>these are only ~1/3 of the extensions I have installed...
                        <img src="chrdev.jpg" alt="Chrome Developer">
                     </p>
                    <p> After doing a quick Google search, I found out that there are 39,263 Chrome themes 
                        and 137,345 Chrome extensions available for installation from the Chrome Web Store as 
                        of 2021 (Dean).  
                        <img src="webstore.png" alt="Chrome Webstore">   
                    </p>
                    <p>The seemingly endless variety and supply of tools to customize one’s Chrome Web Browser 
                        and New Tab only goes to show its importance and impact on one’s daily life.</p>
                    <p>Building off of that idea, I wanted to create a Chrome extension that had the qualities of a 
                        common New Tab extension such as location, weather, date, and time, but also 
                        add a daily insight and journaling feature, perhaps putting more emphasis on 
                        this added feature as well.</p>
                    <p>The <b>daily insight</b> is inspired by oracles and prophecies, however, 
                        instead of giving the user a prediction, it generates a poem that prompts users 
                        to ponder about their day in a way that corresponds to the relatively ‘nonsensical’ poetry. 
                        This nonsensical nature is created using Markov chain text generation with 5 different 
                        poems: “If You Forget Me” by Pablo Neruda, “Housekeeping” by Natasha Trethewey, 
                        “No Man is an Island” by John Donne, “The Peace of Wild Things” by Wendell Berry, 
                        and “There Will Come Soft Rains” by Sara Teasdale.</p>
                    <p>
                        The <b>journal section</b> was implemented for users to write down their thoughts, 
                        ideas, and emotions. Because the text is not stored in any way after it 
                        is released, I hoped that it would create a judgment-free, stress-free, 
                        personal, and convenient space in contrast with the data collecting web 
                        browsers and apps that we use on a daily basis. Also, regardless of the 
                        user taking into account the daily insight or not while writing in this 
                        journal, it would still allow for self-reflection and the release of 
                        pent-up emotions/thoughts.

                        <b>My experience using this extension:</b><br>
                        Though I did not put as much intention as I had expected into reading, 
                        analyzing, and interpreting the poetry, it was reassuring in a way to 
                        have that option available to me. Similar to having a tarot deck and 
                        the knowledge on how to use it, I knew that I could consult this daily 
                        insight feature if had a burning question in my mind or felt unsure about 
                        something, or even if I was just bored (which I did). When I did use this 
                        feature and took the time to think about my day in the context of the 
                        poem, it often lead me to reflect on topics/situations that weren’t 
                        necessarily on my mind at the moment. Because of the random phrases 
                        linked together in these poems, I felt that it also sparked more 
                        creativity within me, which could also be due to the 5 poems I chose.
                        <br>
                        Even when I overlooked both the daily insight and journal sections, 
                        every time I opened up a New Tab to check the time/weather or to 
                        procrastinate, the visual component of it being there still reminded 
                        me to reflect and be mindful of what I was doing. I think that the background 
                        visuals of floating translucent colorful orbs being so hypnotic to me also 
                        aided in that as well.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Moving forward...</b><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I’d like the formatting of the page to cater to all window sizes. 
                        Right now, it only fits correctly on my own screen because it uses absolute positioning. </li>
                            <li> I would fix the daily insight so that it only generates one poem every 24 hours. </li>
                            <li>Accessibility wise, making the features on the left side of the screen be 
                        consistent with the user’s geographical location is something I want to implement as well.</li>
